Unofficial Grok app for Linux. Runs as a flatpak with highly restrictive permissions. Modified to support a copilot key or keyboard shortcut of your choice in a manner similar to the implementation of copilot on windows (requires manually mapping the shortcut via OS settings).

Third party logins are not supported. To allow for file drag and drop, download the FlatSeal flatpak app and allow access to your filesystem. Adjustments can be made for microphone or camera access as well in FlatSeal.
